### Links

- Live Site URL: https://wafae-haida.github.io/Social-links-profile-Project/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (including border radius and RGBA colors)
- Flexbox (including centering techniques)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Hover effects and custom cursor styles

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to create hover effects and change cursor themes using CSS. I also figured out how to use external fonts beyond the standard CSS fonts, and convert lists into buttons. Changing image borders was another skill I picked up. This experience solidified my knowledge in building responsive layouts, and now I'm eager to delve deeper into CSS technology to discover and learn even more.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
    <h1 class="name">Jessica Randall</h1>
    <p class="location">London, United Kingdom</p>
    <p class="description">"Front-end developer and avid reader."</p>
    <div class="list-buttons">
      <ul>
        <li>GitHub</li>
        <li>Frontend Mentor</li>
        <li>LinkedIn</li>
        <li>Twitter</li>
        <li>Instagram</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css ðŸŽ‰{
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'Inter Bold';
    src: url('./assets/fonts/static/Inter-Bold.ttf') format('truetype');
    font-weight: 700;
  }
  .list-buttons ul{
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 15px;
    list-style: none; 
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
  }
  .list-buttons li:hover{
    background-color:hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    cursor: pointer;
    color: black;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

As a beginner in creating responsive pages, I've learned to use HTML and CSS for foundational web development. I'm excited to tackle more complex challenges with multiple components. I'll focus on mastering Flexbox and Grid layouts, refining media queries, and building reusable components like navigation bars and modals.

### Useful resources

- [Copilot] - This helped me understand and refine my web development skills. I really liked the clear explanations and practical advice, and I will definitely use these patterns going forward. Huge thanks to my trusty AI companion for guiding me through the process! ðŸŒŸ
